00:06.005 --> 00:07.005
This is Martin

00:07.010 --> 00:11.009
He is a computing student who has just woken up at 6 in the afternoon

00:12.001 --> 00:13.040
You lazy boy

00:14.030 --> 00:18.001
As you can see Martin likes to keep on top of his busy schedule

00:18.015 --> 00:20.001
As university life can be very busy

00:21.003 --> 00:22.010
What have you found here Martin?

00:22.020 --> 00:25.002
An assignment due in 1 hour

00:25.010 --> 00:27.008
We have so much work to do!

00:34.001 --> 00:35.022
What are we going to do Martin?

00:36.006 --> 00:38.005
Hold on, I've got an idea

00:38.008 --> 00:41.010
how about we drink some student fuel

00:46.005 --> 00:48.001
Not a very convincing roar

01:03.025 --> 01:07.016
STUDENT FUEL!
